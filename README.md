Hello Everyone
Thrilled to share some exciting work I've been doing at AtliQ Data Services! We recently partnered with Mitron Bank to help them tailor a new line of credit cards to their customers' needs.
# The Challenge:
Mitron Bank, a leading financial institution, is looking to expand its offerings with strategic credit card products. To ensure they hit the mark, they entrusted us with analyzing a sample dataset of 4,000 customers across five Indian cities.
# Our Approach:
By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we were able to gain valuable insights into:
# Customer Segmentation:
 We identified distinct customer groups based on demographics and spending habits.
# Spending Patterns:
 We analyzed average monthly expenditure across categories like groceries, travel, and entertainment, revealing unique patterns within each segment.
# Creditworthiness: 
By examining existing credit behaviour, we assessed potential risk profiles.
# Market Research: 
We supplemented our analysis with external data on credit card preferences in major Indian cities.
# Interactive Dashboard:
We created an interactive dashboard for Mitron Bank's team, featuring:
â€¢	User-friendly interface for easy navigation
â€¢	Data filters for deeper analysis by demographics or spending categories
â€¢	Key performance indicators (KPIs) like average transaction value and credit utilization
â€¢	Compelling visualizations like charts and graphs to showcase insights
# Actionable Recommendations:
Based on these insights, we proposed credit card features tailored to specific customer segments:
# Travel rewards cards: 
Appealing to high-spending customers in metro cities.
# Cashback cards:
 Ideal for budget-conscious individuals seeking everyday rewards.
# Low-interest rate cards:
Perfect for those prioritizing responsible credit usage.
# The Impact:
Our data-driven approach not only impressed the Mitron Bank team but also provided them with actionable insights to design credit cards that resonate with their diverse customer base.
This project is a testament to the power of data analytics in crafting targeted financial products. Stay tuned for further updates as we delve deeper with Mitron Bank using their complete customer data!
